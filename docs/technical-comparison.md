- [DWALL vs WinDynamicDesktop](./dwall-vs-windynamicdesktop.md)

## Architecture Comparison

See [shared comparison content](./shared-comparison-content.md) for common architecture differences. For a comparison with WinDynamicDesktop, see [DWALL vs WinDynamicDesktop](./dwall-vs-windynamicdesktop.md).

### DWALL Architecture

DWALL follows a microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
Frontend Layer (Settings UI)
├── Built with: SolidJS + Tauri
├── Communication: File-based configuration
└── Purpose: User interaction and configuration

Backend Layer (Daemon)
├── Language: Rust
├── Frameworks: Tokio (async runtime)
├── Communication: File-based configuration
└── Purpose: Background wallpaper management

Infrastructure Layer
├── Display Management: Platform-specific APIs
├── File System: Configuration persistence
└── Geographic Services: Location and solar calculations
```

#### Key Design Principles:

1. **Process Isolation**: Settings UI and daemon run as completely separate processes
2. **File-based Communication**: No direct IPC, only shared configuration files
3. **Resource Optimization**: Minimal memory footprint for background daemon
4. **Domain-driven Design**: Clear separation of business logic and infrastructure

## Implementation Details

### Solar Position Calculation

#### DWALL Approach

```rust
/// Calculate Julian day using Fliegel-Van Flandern algorithm
fn julian_day(&self) -> f64 {
    // Implementation using astronomical algorithms
}

/// Calculate solar ecliptic longitude using simplified VSOP87 model
fn solar_ecliptic_longitude(t: f64) -> f64 {
    // VSOP87 model implementation
}

/// Calculate atmospheric refraction correction
fn atmospheric_refraction(&self, apparent_altitude: f64) -> f64 {
    // Atmospheric correction for more accurate positioning
}
```

**Advantages:**

- High precision astronomical calculations
- Atmospheric refraction correction
- Polar region handling
- Comprehensive test coverage

#### Auto Dark Mode Approach

See [shared comparison content](./shared-comparison-content.md) for common geographic position handling.

#### WinDynamicDesktop Approach

WinDynamicDesktop uses simpler sunrise/sunset calculations without atmospheric correction:

- Basic astronomical algorithms for sun position
- Time-based theme switching rather than precise solar positioning
- No altitude consideration in calculations
- Limited handling for polar regions
- Relies on external services for some location data

### Wallpaper Management

#### DWALL Approach

- **Theme Structure**: Each theme contains a `solar.json` file defining sun positions for each wallpaper
- **Image Selection**: Algorithm selects closest matching wallpaper based on current sun position
- **Multi-monitor Support**: Per-monitor configuration with automatic detection of monitor changes
- **Cache Strategy**: Solar configuration caching to avoid repeated file reads

#### Auto Dark Mode Approach

See [shared comparison content](./shared-comparison-content.md) for common wallpaper management approaches.

#### WinDynamicDesktop Approach

WinDynamicDesktop uses a simpler theme management approach:

- **Theme Structure**: JSON-based themes with time segments (sunrise, day, sunset, night)
- **Image Selection**: Fixed time-based selection rather than solar position matching
- **Multi-monitor Support**: Basic support with limited per-monitor configuration
- **Customization**: Extensive support for user-created themes

### Resource Management

See [shared comparison content](./shared-comparison-content.md) for common resource usage comparisons.

#### DWALL Resource Usage

- **Daemon Process**: Minimal memory footprint (~2-5MB)
- **Settings UI**: Separate process only active when in use
- **CPU Usage**: Very low, only active during wallpaper updates
- **Background Operations**: Efficient async processing with Tokio

## Conclusion

DWALL's technical approach prioritizes resource efficiency and precision over deep Windows integration. Its architecture is designed to minimize system impact while providing accurate solar-based wallpaper transitions. The separation of concerns between UI and daemon processes, combined with Rust's performance characteristics, results in a lightweight solution that can run unobtrusively in the background.

Alternative solutions like Auto Dark Mode and WinDynamicDesktop take different approaches. Auto Dark Mode's integrated approach provides deeper Windows integration and extensibility but at the cost of higher resource consumption. Its scripting capabilities and gaming optimizations make it suitable for users who need more customization options. WinDynamicDesktop offers a balance between customization and resource usage but lacks the precision of DWALL's solar-based calculations.

For users prioritizing system resources and macOS-like dynamic wallpapers, DWALL's technical approach provides clear advantages. For users requiring deeper integration and extensibility, Auto Dark Mode may be more appropriate.
