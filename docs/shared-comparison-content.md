## Common Technical Specifications

### Resource Usage Comparison

- **DWALL Daemon Process**: Minimal memory footprint (~2-5MB)
- **DWALL Settings UI**: Separate process only active when in use
- **Auto Dark Mode**: Higher memory footprint due to deeper Windows integration (~10-20MB)

### Architecture Differences

#### DWALL Architecture

```
+------------------+     +------------------+
|   Settings UI    |     |     Daemon       |
|   (Tauri/SolidJS)|     |     (Rust)       |
+------------------+     +------------------+
       |                         |
       +---- Config Files -------+
```

Key Design Principles:

1. **Process Isolation**: Settings UI and daemon run as completely separate processes
2. **File-based Communication**: No direct IPC, only shared configuration files
3. **Resource Optimization**: Minimal memory footprint for background daemon

#### Auto Dark Mode Architecture

```
+-----------------------------+
|    Integrated Windows       |
|    Service/Application      |
+-----------------------------+
```

Typical approach:

- Single or closely-coupled processes
- Direct Windows API integration
- Registry-based configuration
- Windows service integration for background operations

## Common Use Case Scenarios

### Choose DWALL When:

- You want macOS-like dynamic wallpapers
- Resource consumption is a primary concern
- You prefer scientifically-aligned wallpaper transitions
- You use multiple monitors and want per-monitor customization
- You want a lightweight solution that runs in the background

### Choose Auto Dark Mode When:

- You primarily want dark/light mode switching
- You need custom scripting capabilities
- You're on ARM-based devices
- You want gaming-specific optimizations
- You prefer deeper Windows integration

## Common Geographic Position Handling

### DWALL Approach

- Automatic location detection with user permission
- Precise astronomical calculations for sun position
- Altitude consideration for more accurate positioning
- Atmospheric refraction correction
- Special handling for polar regions

### Auto Dark Mode Approach

- Basic sunrise/sunset calculations
- Less precise astronomical algorithms
- May rely on external services for location data

## Common Multi-Monitor Support

### DWALL

- Per-monitor wallpaper configuration
- Automatic detection of monitor configuration changes
- Immediate reapplication of wallpapers when monitors are added/removed

### Auto Dark Mode

- Varies by version
- Generally more limited support
